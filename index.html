          Raga Svara is a learning and healing institution. We want everyone to
          learn how to heal. e intent and ownership of transformation lies
          within each guest. Our goal is to provide a holistic experience to
          rejuvenate the body and mind. While we keep on gaining pace, playing
          catch up, and running ahead, we lose our existential foothold. In the
          constant ux that we are thrown into we can't nd our sense of being,
          our sense of wholeness. ere is a spectre of turmoil, pervasive and
          omnipresent. We seek slowness, we seek togetherness, we seek balance.
          We seek peace. We are a place to take a pause and connect with
          ourselves and with our ecology. To be really in sync with oneself and
          nature is to understand and experience the time scale of nature around
          us. e road to our wellbeing is so simple and clear yet riddled with
          hardships. Eating (essential, natural, clean) food, taking a stroll
          among the trees, practising (yoga), observing self-discipline,
          watching and hearing the birds, breathing in clear air, smelling the
          sweet owers and pungent leaves. ese go a long way in renewing and
          sustaining our body, mind and spirit. In Carl Jung's words, â€œWhen you
          walk with naked feet, how can you ever forget the earth?

            <h4>Ayurveda</h4>
            <p>
              Ayurveda means the science of life or the way of life. Originating
              from the Vedas, it is the oldest and most comprehensive system of
              healthcare. It is the precursor to most systems of medicine in the
              world. Pleasantly disposed with a contented mind, senses and
              spirit Achieving this may seem difficult, but Ayurveda provides
              time tested, insighful tools to help us get there.

              having a transformative experience. Every group or individual
              session at the Retreat seamlessly blends the spiritual and
              physical and has balanced inclusions of Asanas (Hatha Yoga
              postures), Pranayama (breathing techniques), Pratyahara, Mantra &
              Dhyana (Meditation).
